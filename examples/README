			    Grove Examples

The following examples are listed in concept order, starting with the
first will lead into concepts in the later examples.  All examples use
XML::Parser.

    grove.pl
        Uses the simplest form of XML objects to recursively dump the
        object tree, similar to the `debug' style of XML::Parser.

    iter.pl
        Almost identical to `grove.pl' except that it uses iterators
        to keep track of the position in the tree rather than keeping
        it's own context.

    visitor.pl
        Uses a visitor class and callbacks to dump the tree.  This is
        similar to the `sub' style of XML::Parser except that it uses
        generic `visit_element' callbacks instead of by-tag-name
        callbacks (see my-html.pl for that).

    my-html.pl, my-html.html
        Uses a visitor class and by-tag-name callbacks to add new tags
        to HTML-like documents.  This example in particular shows one
        way to embed Perl code into HTML documents.
